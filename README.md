## Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Tool with LSTM and Web Interface

Welcome to the Stock Market Analysis project! This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict stock prices using time-series data and provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the predictions. Built using Python, Flask, and Jupyter Notebooks, it aims to deliver accurate forecasting of stock market trends with an intuitive and interactive experience.

## Project Overview

The Stock Market Analysis project is designed to predict stock prices by training LSTM models on historical time-series data and presenting the results through a web interface. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, backtesting, detailed visualizations, and a web application to provide comprehensive insights into stock market trends and prediction results.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed historical stock market data for effective model training, including normalization and feature engineering.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Performed detailed analysis of stock market trends to understand historical price movements and predict future trends.
- **LSTM Model Training**: Designed and trained LSTM models to forecast stock prices, capturing complex temporal dependencies in time-series data.
- **Backtesting and Model Tuning**: Conducted rigorous backtesting and tuning of LSTM models to enhance prediction accuracy and ensure reliable performance metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Created detailed visualizations using Python libraries to illustrate stock market trends, prediction results, and model performance.
- **Web Application**: Developed a web interface using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to interact with the model, visualize predictions, and explore historical data.
